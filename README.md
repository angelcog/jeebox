# jeebox

Learn more about Jeebox at http://jeebox.org

I'll write a proper readme file later.

For now, you can compile Jeebox using:

    cd </path/to/jeebox-master>
    cmake -BBuild; cd Build; sudo make

For the moment Jeebox is 32-bit only. However the tests work and you can compile projects with it. I am working on a 64-bit version. My 32-bit version made some assumptions that aren't valid in 64-bits.

The Cpp/JB.cpp file is actually auto-generated by my compiler, `Speedie`. This means any changes to it, will be quite hard to merge back into the main source. Also, its pretty hard to understand because it's auto-generated.

Speedie basically takes Speedie source-code, and turns it into C. "Compile to C" basically. Almost all early compilers did this! Even C++ and Java did this once. Speedie isn't part of the distribution, it's just Jeebox, but it's nice to know that Jeebox is being used for a big real-world project (Speedie is based on Jeebox).
